## O - Objective
Today, we learned how to use AI to assist in coding and completed a practical exercise on a Parking Lot. We experienced the process of receiving code suggestions from AI and applying them to our tasks, which helped improve our coding efficiency.

## R - Reflective
Using AI in coding was both fascinating and challenging. While AI suggestions were helpful, there were moments where the suggestions required adjustments or a deeper understanding of the problem. It highlighted the importance of balancing automation with human expertise.

## I - Interpretive
The integration of AI tools in the coding process can significantly streamline tasks and reduce repetitive work. However, it also emphasized the need for developers to critically assess AI-generated code and adapt it to fit the project requirements effectively.

## D - Decisional
In the future, I will incorporate AI tools more frequently into my workflow to boost productivity, but I'll also ensure to thoroughly review and customize AI-generated code to ensure it aligns with the project goals and coding standards.
