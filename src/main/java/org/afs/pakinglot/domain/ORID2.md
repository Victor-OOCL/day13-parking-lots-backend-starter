## O - Objective
Today, I learned how to create user maps and cards, attended a session on cloud-native concepts, and participated in a retrospective meeting. These activities helped me understand user-centric design and gain insights into cloud-native architecture, along with the value of retrospective meetings in improving team processes.

## R - Reflective
Creating user maps and cards allowed me to think more deeply about the user's needs and how to design around them. The cloud-native session gave me a new perspective on building scalable, resilient applications. The retrospective meeting was valuable for reflecting on team performance and identifying areas for improvement.

## I - Interpretive
Learning user maps and cards emphasized the importance of understanding user journeys and building with the userâ€™s perspective in mind. The cloud-native session clarified the significance of decentralized, scalable systems. The retro meeting highlighted how continuous feedback and collaboration can drive improvement in team dynamics and project outcomes.

## D - Decisional
I will incorporate user-centered design principles more effectively by using user maps and cards in future projects. I also plan to explore cloud-native technologies further and apply these concepts in building more scalable applications. Additionally, I will encourage more frequent retro meetings in my team to foster a culture of continuous improvement.
